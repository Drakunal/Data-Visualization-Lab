#At first glance this feature does not appear very useful, 
#but the simplicity of the algorithm comes in handy. 
#If you sort the input data in order of priority the 
#result is a plot with labels that emphasise important 
#data points.

#A variation on geom_text() is geom_label(): 
#it draws a rounded rectangle behind the text. 
#This makes it useful for adding labels to plots with 
#busy backgrounds:
